        I have extensive in the food & drink industry, both managing and developing products and businesses in retail and hospitality. The frustrations I had using the tech available to that sector were part of the motivation I used to seek a career in software development, coupled with my curiosity surrounding problem-solving, my furtive imagination, and my drive to make the tedious bits of life less tedious. I have recently completed a fixed term internship at Yearbook Machine, where I was able to apply my skills in a professional environment and learn from a team of experienced developers.

        A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

        It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

        When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

        It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
